# Pixel Gladiators: 1v1 Arena Duel
Pixel Gladiators is a fast-paced 1v1 arena duel game developed using Python and PyOpenGL. The game features two stickman gladiators—one controlled by the player and the other by an AI—battling it out in a dynamic arena. The player can move, jump, and shoot bullets, while the AI mimics these actions and dynamically dodges attacks. Falling obstacles add an extra layer of challenge, and health bars track the combatants' vitality. The game ends when one gladiator’s health reaches zero. Built with the Midpoint Line and Midpoint Circle algorithms, the game renders all elements using only GL_POINTS, showcasing the power of fundamental computer graphics techniques.
